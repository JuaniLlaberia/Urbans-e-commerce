## Urban's Clothing Project
This was so far my biggest personal project, where I implemented everything I have learned so far in my developer journey. From the design, the front-end code and the serverless back-end. 
Using React.js I created this clothing brand web application. Which contains an user side (the actual store) and the owner/admin side (dashboard and panel to control the whole application). The owner is able to create custom products, categories, discounts, manage orders and complains, customize some aspects of the bussines. In addition to this feature, tracing sales information and stock is possible via the dashboard. In second, customers can surf through the different pages looking for their favorite products. They can save them for future purchases or go to the shopping cart and buy them.

Admins in most of the features are able to create, edit, delete, sort, filter all the tables as needed for a better UX. 

All the admin features are thought to avoid having to even think of code, everything can be done with a friendly UI and then the difficult proccess will happend behind the scenes (The interaction with the database, the image optimization, filtering queries, etc). For the database I utilized Supabase and its great features (Auth, file storage, tables).

The design is 100% responsive and mobile friendly.

Some of the product images where generated by AI tools.
